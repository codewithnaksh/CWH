        A Siamese cat with eyes so blue, <br>Sits on a bed, with nothing to do. <br>Her
        fur is soft, <br>her eyes are bright, <br>She's a vision of beauty, in the soft
        light. <br><br>She looks around, <br>with a curious stare, <br>Wondering what she'll do,
        <br>while sitting there. <br>She licks her paw, <br>and then her nose, <br>And then she
        stretches, <br>from her head to her toes. <br><br>She's a creature of grace, with a
        heart so pure, And when she looks at you, you can't help but adore. Her
        eyes are like sapphires, so bright and clear, And when she purrs, it's
        music to your ear. So if you see a Siamese cat with eyes so blue, Take a
        moment to admire her, and say "mew". For she's a special creature,
        that's for sure, And she'll bring joy to your heart, forevermore.
